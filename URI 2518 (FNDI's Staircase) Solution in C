 /*n=number of stairs

h=hight,,acts as a side of the triangle
c=acts as aside of triangle
 
hypo=is the hypotenuse of the triangle.
hypo acts as the length of every stairs,
if num of stairs then total length
of the new square is n*hypo .
 
l = length of stair,,but acts as the
width of the new square.
 
area=the area of new square or ramp surface.
